Converting Markdown to html

# Background

Have you ever thought of writing a dev blog? If you have then you might have come across various ways to go forth, like using a third-party blog site ([HashNode](https://hashnode.com/) or [Dev.to](https://dev.to/)).Like thats the easy path , without any hassle or extra work. But who am I kidding , I am a dev (or I aspire to be) I sure love to make my work harder and try to come up with weird ideas, just like this one.

As I was saying I wanted to write a blog and to be honest I really like writing in ```Markdown``` and github's markdown rendering is really beautiful and pragmatic. So I thought that how can I write in markdown and convert it to a static website to be shown as a blogsite. While doing research for the same, I came across ***[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)***. What is eleventy you ask, It is basically a **simple static site generator** which can generate a static webpage by converting any of the templating files which also includes markdown. And you might say there you go! Problem solved, right? Yeah kinda, actually I don't want to use a third party templating engine and that's why I started thinking of doing this my own way in the first place. And there goes the easy path.

So what should I do in this situation, After thinking I came to a conclusion that I should make a markdown to html page templating engine of my own (I used a node package to do the conversion) and started this project.

# How it works

Ok with the background out of the way, lets talk about how it works.
